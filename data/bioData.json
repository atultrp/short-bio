      "bio": "Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) was an American civil rights leader, women's rights activist, and suffragist. She was born into a Quaker family in Massachusetts and was raised with a strong belief in equality for all people. Anthony began her activism by working with the American Anti-Slavery Society in the 1850s, and later became involved in the women's suffrage movement. She was a co-founder of the National Woman Suffrage Association in 1869, and worked tirelessly to secure voting rights for women. Anthony was also a prominent speaker, writer, and organizer, traveling across the United States and Europe to give speeches and gather support for women's suffrage. In 1872, Anthony was arrested for voting illegally in the presidential election, and her trial helped to bring attention to the cause of women's suffrage. Although Anthony did not live to see the passage of the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in 1920, which granted women the right to vote, her tireless advocacy and dedication to the cause paved the way for future generations of women to fight for their rights.",
      "briefBio": "Susan B. Anthony (1820-1906) was an American social reformer and women's rights activist who played a pivotal role in the women's suffrage movement. Born in Massachusetts, she grew up in a Quaker family that advocated for social equality and abolitionism. In the 1850s, Anthony became involved in the temperance movement and later turned her attention to women's rights, specifically suffrage.\n\nAnthony co-founded the National Woman Suffrage Association with Elizabeth Cady Stanton and served as its president from 1892 until 1900. She tirelessly worked to promote women's suffrage, giving speeches across the country and leading campaigns for women's right to vote. Despite facing criticism and opposition, Anthony persevered and became a symbol of the suffrage movement.\n\nAnthony also worked to promote other social reforms, such as the abolition of slavery and the improvement of labor conditions for women. She believed that social change could only come through activism and direct action, and dedicated her life to fighting for the rights of marginalized groups.\n\nToday, Anthony is remembered as one of the most influential figures in the women's suffrage movement and a trailblazer for gender equality. Her legacy continues to inspire activists and advocates for social justice around the world.",

      "briefBio": "Ingrid Bergman was a Swedish actress who achieved international fame during Hollywood's Golden Age. She was born on August 29, 1915, in Stockholm, Sweden, and began her acting career in Swedish and German films before making her Hollywood debut in 1939 in the film Intermezzo: A Love Story.\n\nBergman's early Hollywood roles included Casablanca, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Gaslight, for which she won an Academy Award for Best Actress. She also starred in many successful films in the 1950s, such as Anastasia, The Inn of the Sixth Happiness, and Indiscreet.\n\nBergman's personal life was often the subject of public scrutiny due to her multiple marriages and affairs, including her highly publicized relationship with Italian director Roberto Rossellini, which resulted in a scandal and backlash from American audiences.\n\nDespite the controversy, Bergman's talent as an actress remained undisputed, and she continued to work in film, television, and stage productions throughout her career. She received three Academy Awards for Best Actress, two Emmy Awards, and a Tony Award, among numerous other accolades.\n\nBergman died on August 29, 1982, in London, England, at the age of 67, leaving behind a legacy as one of the greatest actresses of the 20th century.",

During his presidency, Trump pursued an America First policy, focusing on trade, immigration, and national security.

      "briefBio": "Donald Trump is a businessman and politician who served as the 45th President of the United States from 2017 to 2021. He was born on June 14, 1946, in Queens, New York, and grew up in a wealthy family that was involved in real estate development. After attending Fordham University and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, Trump began working for his family's business, eventually becoming the president of the Trump Organization.\n\nIn addition to his business career, Trump became involved in politics in the 1980s and was a vocal advocate for conservative issues. He flirted with presidential runs in 1988, 2000, and 2012, but did not officially launch a campaign until 2015. Running on a platform of economic nationalism and \"America First\" policies, Trump won the Republican nomination and went on to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election.\n\nDuring his presidency, Trump was known for his unconventional approach to governing and his frequent use of social media to communicate directly with the American people. He was impeached twice by the House of Representatives, first in 2019 over his dealings with Ukraine, and again in 2021 over his role in inciting the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol. Despite his controversial tenure, Trump remains a prominent figure in American politics and continues to be a divisive figure in the country.",

      "briefBio": "Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, also known as Mahatma Gandhi, was a prominent Indian independence activist and political leader who is recognized as the father of the nation in India. He was born on October 2, 1869, in Porbandar, Gujarat, India, and was assassinated on January 30, 1948, in New Delhi.\n\nGandhi was a lawyer by profession but later dedicated his life to India's struggle for independence from British rule. He is known for his philosophy of nonviolent resistance, which he called satyagraha. Gandhi led many peaceful protests and civil disobedience campaigns, including the famous Salt March, which was a turning point in India's independence movement.\n\nGandhi was not only a political leader but also a spiritual leader who emphasized the importance of truth, nonviolence, and self-sufficiency. He believed in the equality of all people and fought against discrimination based on caste, religion, or gender.\n\nGandhi's impact was not only limited to India but also influenced many civil rights leaders and movements around the world, including Martin Luther King Jr. in the United States. His teachings and principles continue to inspire people today to fight for justice, equality, and peace through nonviolent means.\n\nIn recognition of his contributions to India's independence movement and his advocacy for peace, Gandhi was nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize five times but never won. He remains an iconic figure in Indian history and a symbol of peace and nonviolence around the world.",

He was born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Odisha, and was raised in a politically active family. Bose's ideology was based on the principles of nationalism, socialism, and militarism, and he strongly believed in achieving India's independence through armed struggle.\n\nIn 1921, Bose became the president of the Indian National Congress, but his differences with Mahatma Gandhi led to his resignation in 1939. He then formed the Forward Bloc, a left-wing nationalist party that aimed to achieve India's independence through a revolution. During World War II, Bose sought the help of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan to overthrow British rule in India. He formed the Indian National Army (INA), also known as the Azad Hind Fauj, with Japanese assistance.\n\nBose's military campaign against the British in India was unsuccessful, and he died on August 18, 1945, in a plane crash in Taiwan. His death remains shrouded in mystery, and there are various theories about his fate. Bose's contributions to the Indian independence movement are widely recognized, and he is remembered as a hero and a symbol of courage and sacrifice in the struggle for freedom.",

He also signed the Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, which declared that all slaves in the Confederate states \"shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free.\" Lincoln was known for his oratory skills and delivered many famous speeches, including the Gettysburg Address, which is considered one of the most important speeches in American history.\n\nLincoln was assassinated on April 14, 1865, by John Wilkes Booth, a Confederate sympathizer. His death was a great loss to the country, and he is remembered as one of America's greatest leaders.",

      "bio": "Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was an English physicist, mathematician, and astronomer. He is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists in history and is best known for his laws of motion and universal gravitation. Born prematurely in a small village in Lincolnshire, Newton showed an early aptitude for mathematics and scientific inquiry. After studying at Trinity College, Cambridge, he developed his theories on calculus, optics, and gravity. His landmark book, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, laid out the laws of motion and universal gravitation that continue to be foundational in modern physics. Newton's other contributions to science include the development of the reflecting telescope, the study of the nature of light and color, and the discovery of the laws of cooling and the law of refraction. He was knighted by Queen Anne in 1705 and served as the president of the Royal Society from 1703 until his death in 1727.",
      "briefBio": "Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was an English mathematician, physicist, and astronomer. He is widely recognized as one of the most influential scientists of all time, making groundbreaking contributions to the fields of mathematics, physics, and optics. Newton formulated the laws of motion, including the famous law of universal gravitation, which explained how objects are attracted to one another. He also developed calculus independently and used it to solve problems in physics and mathematics.\n\nIn addition to his contributions to science, Newton also played a role in politics and economics. He served as a member of parliament for the University of Cambridge, and he was appointed warden and later master of the Royal Mint, where he worked to combat counterfeit currency and improve the efficiency of the minting process.\n\nNewton was a complex figure with many interests beyond science and politics. He was deeply religious and wrote extensively about his interpretations of the Bible. He also devoted time to studying alchemy and mysticism. Despite his eccentricities, Newton's impact on the world of science and mathematics remains profound, and his work continues to be studied and admired to this day.",
